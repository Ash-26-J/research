### Research

This is a small research based which was conducted in order to check the similarity in results of different prompts in different LLMs

### top 5 LLMS
[TOP 5 LLMs](https://github.com/Ash-26-J/research/blob/main/llm):the top 5 LLMs identifed 

### Data set collection 

We collected the results of the prompts from 5 different field .Each field we given 10 prompts

### Data set evaluation

We compared the dataset that is the prompts from different LLMs for each field using a simple Python program which showed how similar the results of the prompts are keeping 0.5 as threshold value ,anything > 0.5 it is considered as simialr

### Conclusion 

Based  on the results generated after comparing the results of different LLMs ,we can say that most of the LLMs didnt show simialr results
