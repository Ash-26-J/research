Methods to Secure IoT Devices 🔐
IoT devices are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to weak security configurations. Here are best practices to protect them:

1. Network Security
📌 Use Strong, Encrypted Wi-Fi – Set WPA3 encryption for routers.
📌 Separate IoT Network – Keep IoT devices on a separate Wi-Fi from personal devices.
📌 Disable Unnecessary Ports – Close unused network ports to prevent unauthorized access.
📌 Use Firewalls & Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) – Detect and block suspicious activity.

2. Device Authentication & Access Control
🔑 Change Default Credentials – Default usernames/passwords are easily hacked.
🔑 Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Prevents unauthorized logins.
🔑 Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Restrict access based on user roles.

3. Data Encryption & Secure Communication
🔒 Use End-to-End Encryption – Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
🔒 Enable Secure Protocols – Use TLS, HTTPS, and MQTT with encryption.
🔒 Disable Unnecessary Features – Turn off remote access if not needed.

4. Regular Software Updates & Patching
🛠 Keep Firmware Updated – Install security patches immediately.
🛠 Enable Automatic Updates – Reduces risk of outdated vulnerabilities.
🛠 Monitor Vendor Support – Avoid devices that no longer receive updates.

5. AI & Behavioral Monitoring
📊 Use AI-Powered Threat Detection – Detects unusual device activity.
📊 Set Up Anomaly Detection – Alerts for abnormal network traffic.
📊 Monitor Device Logs – Regularly check for security incidents.

6. Secure APIs & Cloud Integration
🌐 Use Secure API Authentication – OAuth, JWT for API communication.
🌐 Limit Data Sharing – Only send necessary data to the cloud.
🌐 Enable Cloud Security Controls – Use firewalls, access logs, and encryption for cloud storage.
