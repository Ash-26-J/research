. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) â€“ Best for General Security
Type: Symmetric encryption (same key for encryption and decryption)

Key Sizes: 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit

Security: Highly secure, used by governments (e.g., US NSA)

Best For:
âœ… Data storage encryption (hard drives, SSDs)
âœ… Secure communication (TLS, VPNs)
âœ… Banking and financial transactions

ðŸ’¡ Verdict: AES-256 is the most secure and widely used encryption standard today.

2. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) â€“ Best for Secure Communication
Type: Asymmetric encryption (public/private key pair)

Key Sizes: 2048-bit, 4096-bit (longer is more secure)

Security: Very strong but slower than AES

Best For:
âœ… Secure email (PGP encryption)
âœ… Digital signatures and certificates (SSL/TLS)
âœ… Blockchain transactions

ðŸ’¡ Verdict: RSA-2048 is secure today but may be vulnerable to quantum computers in the future.

3. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) â€“ Best for Mobile & IoT
Type: Asymmetric encryption

Key Sizes: 256-bit ECC â‰ˆ 3072-bit RSA (more efficient)

Security: Provides the same security as RSA but with shorter keys

Best For:
âœ… Mobile and IoT devices (low power usage)
âœ… Cryptocurrency wallets (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
âœ… Secure messaging apps (WhatsApp, Signal)

ðŸ’¡ Verdict: ECC is lightweight and ideal for devices with limited resources.

4. Blowfish & Twofish â€“ Best for Custom Encryption Needs
Type: Symmetric encryption

Key Sizes: Blowfish (32â€“448 bits), Twofish (up to 256 bits)

Security: Strong, but AES is more widely supported

Best For:
âœ… Password hashing (bcrypt uses Blowfish)
âœ… File encryption
