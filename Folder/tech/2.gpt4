Applications of Blockchain
Blockchain technology has diverse applications across multiple industries due to its decentralized, transparent, and secure nature. Some key applications include:

1. Finance & Banking
Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)

Cross-border payments (reduces transaction costs and time)

Smart contracts (self-executing contracts without intermediaries)

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) (peer-to-peer lending, staking, and yield farming)

2. Supply Chain Management
Product tracking (ensures authenticity and transparency)

Anti-counterfeiting (proves the origin of goods)

Automated inventory management

3. Healthcare
Secure patient records (privacy-focused decentralized storage)

Drug traceability (ensures medicine authenticity)

Clinical trials (tamper-proof data storage)

4. Government & Voting Systems
Secure digital voting (prevents election fraud)

Public records management (land ownership, ID verification)

Transparent tax collection

5. Real Estate
Smart contracts for property sales (eliminates middlemen)

Property ownership records (reduces fraud and paperwork)

6. Entertainment & Media
Royalty payments & copyright protection (ensures artists get paid fairly)

Decentralized content platforms (prevents censorship)

7. Internet of Things (IoT)
Secure data sharing (blockchain ensures device data integrity)

Automated machine-to-machine payments (smart contracts facilitate transactions)
