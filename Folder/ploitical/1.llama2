Donald Trump's immigration policies were a cornerstone of his administration, with significant changes aimed at reducing immigration numbers and tightening controls on entry. Here are some key aspects of his immigration policies:

- Family-Based Immigration: Trump's administration made attempts to limit family-based sponsorships, which allow U.S. citizens and permanent residents to petition for close relatives to join them in the United States. This could lead to proposals reducing the number of family-based visas, especially for relatives outside the immediate family category ¹.
- Employment-Based Green Card Eligibility: Trump advocated for a "merit-based" system, prioritizing certain skills, education, or job offers over family ties. This could result in a reduction in family-based visa quotas and an increase in employment-based visas for individuals with specialized skills ¹.
- DACA and Dreamers: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program faced challenges under Trump's administration, with attempts to phase it out. This led to uncertainty for DACA recipients and applicants, with possible restrictions on renewals ¹.
- Asylum and Refugee Policies: Trump's administration reduced the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. and increased barriers for asylum seekers at the southern border. Expected changes include stricter rules for asylum eligibility and increased scrutiny in the asylum application process ¹.
- Border Security and Enforcement: Trump emphasized a strong stance on border security, including plans to expand the border wall and deter unauthorized immigration. This led to increased funding for ICE and Customs and Border Protection, resulting in more resources devoted to deportation and enforcement measures ¹.

These policies reflect the administration's commitment to stringent immigration enforcement and border security. If you're concerned about these changes, consider staying informed and seeking guidance from reputable sources, such as CitizenPath ¹.
