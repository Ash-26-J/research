Birthright Citizenship in the U.S. & Related Issues
What Is Birthright Citizenship?
Birthright citizenship in the U.S. is based on the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status. This is known as "jus soli" (right of the soil).

Legal Foundation
14th Amendment (1868):

"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States..."

U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898):

The Supreme Court ruled that children of noncitizens born in the U.S. are citizens.

Issues & Controversies
1. Immigration & "Anchor Babies" Debate
Some critics argue that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to give birth so their children gain citizenship and later sponsor family members for legal residency.

The term “anchor baby” is controversial, as it implies misuse of birthright citizenship.

2. Birth Tourism
Some foreigners travel to the U.S. to give birth and secure citizenship for their child.

Common among wealthy families from China, Russia, and the Middle East.

The U.S. has cracked down on birth tourism visa fraud.

3. Calls for Ending Birthright Citizenship
Donald Trump proposed ending birthright citizenship through an executive order, but legal scholars argue that changing the 14th Amendment would require a constitutional amendment.

Some conservative lawmakers support restricting citizenship to children of U.S. citizens and legal residents.

4. Legal & Human Rights Concerns
Removing birthright citizenship could increase statelessness (children born in the U.S. might not get citizenship anywhere).

It could disproportionately affect immigrant communities and minorities.
