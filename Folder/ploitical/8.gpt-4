​Combating corruption remains a critical challenge worldwide, necessitating robust and effective policies both within countries and through international cooperation. Below is an overview of India's anti-corruption measures, followed by a discussion of global anti-corruption policies.​

Anti-Corruption Policies in India
India has established a comprehensive legal and institutional framework to address corruption, primarily through the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PCA).​

Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: This Act consolidates and amends laws related to the prevention of corruption in India. It criminalizes the acceptance and giving of bribes, both for public servants and private individuals involved in corrupt practices. The PCA underwent significant amendments in 2018 to enhance its effectiveness in combating corruption. ​

Anti-Corruption Policies Abroad
Globally, numerous countries have enacted laws and established institutions to combat corruption. Notable examples include:​

United States:

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA): Enacted in 1977, the FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and citizens from bribing foreign officials for business advantages. It also mandates accurate financial record-keeping. However, recent policy shifts have seen a reduction in enforcement, raising concerns about global corruption efforts. ​

European Union:

The EU has developed legislation aimed at preventing corruption within its institutions and member states. This includes measures to ensure transparency in public procurement and the establishment of anti-corruption bodies. ​

New Zealand:

Known for its low corruption levels, New Zealand enforces robust anti-corruption laws and emphasizes a zero-tolerance culture towards bribery. The private sector plays a vital role in maintaining integrity through comprehensive compliance systems and clear anti-corruption policies. ​

OECD Convention on Combating Bribery:

As of 2025, 46 countries have ratified this convention, committing to criminalize bribery of foreign public officials and to enforce anti-bribery laws effectively. ​

Specialized Anti-Corruption Courts:

Countries such as Albania, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Ukraine, and Zimbabwe have established specialized courts to expedite the trial of corruption cases, aiming for more efficient and focused adjudication. ​

Challenges and Global Trends
Despite these efforts, challenges persist:​

Enforcement Gaps: Inconsistent enforcement of anti-corruption laws can undermine their effectiveness. For instance, recent reports suggest that the U.S. has reduced enforcement of foreign bribery laws, potentially impacting global anti-corruption initiatives. ​

Asset Recovery: Recovering assets misappropriated through corruption remains a complex task. Efforts in countries like Bangladesh highlight the difficulties in tracing and repatriating stolen funds. ​

International Cooperation: Corruption often transcends borders, necessitating international collaboration. Conventions like the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and initiatives by organizations such as Transparency International play crucial roles in fostering global cooperation.
