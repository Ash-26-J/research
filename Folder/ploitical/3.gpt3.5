India is balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability and has committed to several international and national-level climate policies.

1. International Commitments
Paris Agreement (2015): India pledged to cut its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels) and achieve net-zero by 2070.

International Solar Alliance (ISA): A global initiative led by India to promote solar energy adoption.

COP26 & COP28 Goals: India announced ambitious renewable energy targets and a commitment to phasing down coal.

2. National Policies & Programs
National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC): Includes 8 missions focusing on solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, and water conservation.

State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs): Each Indian state has its own climate action strategies.

Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME): Promotes EV adoption and reduced fossil fuel dependence.

Renewable Energy Goals: India aims for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by 2030.

Afforestation Programs: Initiatives like National Afforestation Programme and Green India Mission support reforestation.

3. Carbon Markets & Regulations
Energy Conservation Act (2022): Establishes a carbon credit trading system.

Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) Scheme: Encourages industries to reduce emissions.

Inflation Reduction Act (2022): Largest climate investment in U.S. history ($369 billion for clean energy).

Clean Power Plan: Aims to reduce carbon emissions from power plants.

Net Zero by 2050: A long-term decarbonization goal.

European Union (EU)
European Green Deal: Aims to make the EU climate-neutral by 2050.

Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM): A tax on carbon-intensive imports.

Emissions Trading System (ETS): Cap-and-trade system to limit industrial emissions.

China
Net Zero by 2060 Goal: The world’s largest emitter is focusing on renewable energy and electric vehicles.

National Carbon Trading Market: Launched in 2021, the world’s largest emissions trading system.

Other Notable Policies
Canada: Carbon pricing & clean energy investment.
