In India, the right to freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. However, this right is not absolute and is subject to "reasonable restrictions" as outlined in Article 19(2). Here's a breakdown:

Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19(1)(a)):

This right allows Indian citizens to express their views and opinions freely through various mediums, including speech, writing, printing, and visual representations.
It is considered a cornerstone of Indian democracy, enabling public discourse and criticism.
Restrictions on Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19(2)):

The Indian Constitution permits the government to impose "reasonable restrictions" on this right in the interest of:

Sovereignty and integrity of India:
This prevents speech that threatens the nation's unity.
Security of the State:
This restricts speech that could endanger national security.
Friendly relations with foreign states:
This aims to maintain positive diplomatic relations.
Public order:
This prevents speech that could disrupt peace and tranquility.
Decency or morality:
This restricts obscene or offensive speech.
Contempt of court:
This prevents speech that undermines the judiciary's authority.
Defamation:
This prevents speech that harms an individual's reputation.
Incitement to an offence:
This prevents speech that encourages illegal activities.
Key Considerations:

"Reasonable restrictions":
The courts play a crucial role in determining whether restrictions are "reasonable."
Restrictions must be proportionate and not excessively curtail the right to free speech.
Balancing rights:
The legal system aims to balance the right to free speech with other important societal interests.
The supreme court of India has made many rulings over the years, that help define and clarify the boundries of the freedom of speech.
