Anti-Corruption Policies in India
India has implemented various anti-corruption laws and initiatives to combat corruption within its government agencies and public sector businesses. Here are some key aspects of India's anti-corruption framework:

Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA):

The PCA is the primary legislation addressing corruption in India. It has been amended to increase penalties for bribery and to include provisions for corporate liability. The amendments align India's anti-corruption laws with international standards, such as the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC)5455.
The act criminalizes both the giving and receiving of bribes, with penalties including fines and imprisonment of up to seven years54.
Whistleblower Protection:

While there is no comprehensive national legislation for whistleblower protection, some provisions exist within internal policies of companies and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)55.
Enforcement Agencies:

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) are key agencies responsible for investigating corruption cases in India. The CBI has police powers across the country, while the CVC oversees vigilance administration in central government organizations5556.
Corporate Compliance:

Companies are encouraged to implement robust anti-bribery policies and conduct due diligence on their business partners and vendors to mitigate corruption risks. Failure to prevent bribery is not specifically criminalized, but companies can raise a defense if they have implemented adequate anti-bribery measures5556.
State-Level Initiatives:

Various states in India have their own anti-corruption bureaus and initiatives. For example, the Andhra Pradesh Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has conducted large-scale investigations into corruption cases57.
Anti-Corruption Policies Abroad
Globally, anti-corruption policies aim to combat corruption through legal frameworks, enforcement mechanisms, and international cooperation. Here are some key initiatives and policies from around the world:

United States:

The U.S. Department of State works to prevent graft, strengthen investigation and prosecution of corruption, promote transparency, and empower civil society and independent media to expose corruption. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to combat corruption globally and support democratic governance5859.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. companies and individuals from engaging in bribery abroad. The act has been amended to raise the standard of proof for bribery and applies to foreign firms and persons who facilitate corrupt payments within U.S. territory60.
European Union:

The EU has implemented strict rules on the prevention of corruption, including measures related to money laundering, public procurement, asset recovery, and whistleblowing. The European Public Prosecutor's Office and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) play crucial roles in investigating and prosecuting cross-border corruption cases61.
International Organizations:

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) fights bribery in international business transactions to strengthen development, reduce poverty, and bolster confidence in markets and governments. The OECD promotes a unified front against foreign bribery through concerted efforts of its member countries62.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) focuses on improving governance and fighting corruption to promote more inclusive and sustainable growth. The IMF's governance policy aims to address economic vulnerabilities, including corruption, that are critical to macroeconomic performance63.
Global Initiatives:

The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) is a multilateral treaty that provides a global framework for fighting corruption. It includes measures related to prevention, criminalization, international cooperation, and asset recovery58.
The Global Anti-Corruption Risk Map developed by Baker McKenzie helps companies manage and address compliance and risk management concerns related to anti-bribery and corruption laws around the world64.
