The United Nations has made significant efforts to promote global health care through various resolutions. One notable example is the Political Declaration on "Universal Health Coverage (UHC): expanding our ambition for health and well-being in a post-COVID world," adopted at the UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting in 2023. This declaration reaffirms the commitment to achieving universal health coverage by 2030, ensuring that everyone receives the health care they need without facing financial hardship ¹.

Another important resolution is "Global health and foreign policy: an inclusive approach to strengthening health systems" (document A/74/L.26), adopted by the General Assembly in 2019. This resolution emphasizes the need for an inclusive approach to strengthening health systems, ensuring access to health care for all, and promoting sexual and reproductive health services ².

The UN has also made efforts to address specific health-related issues, such as:

- Access to Medicines: The UN has reaffirmed the right to use provisions contained in the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which provides flexibilities for the protection of public health and promotes access to medicines for all ².
- Sexual and Reproductive Health: The UN has emphasized the importance of ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning and maternal health care ².
- Health Systems Strengthening: The UN has called for strengthening health systems, including primary health care, to provide universal access to health care services ¹ ².
