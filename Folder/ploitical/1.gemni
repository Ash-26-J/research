Donald Trump's immigration policies have been a defining aspect of his political career, marked by a focus on stricter enforcement, border security, and limitations on both legal and illegal immigration. Here's a summary of key themes and actions:   

Key Policy Areas:

Border Security and the Border Wall:
A central campaign promise was the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.   
Emphasis on increased border patrol and the use of technology for border surveillance.   
Enforcement of Immigration Laws:
"Zero tolerance" policy, which led to the separation of families at the border.   
Increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity and deportations.   
Efforts to limit "sanctuary cities."   
Legal Immigration:
Restrictions on certain visa programs.   
Changes to the "public charge" rule, making it harder for immigrants who might rely on public assistance to obtain green cards.
Attempts to limit family-based immigration.   
Asylum and Refugees:
Stricter asylum requirements.   
The "Remain in Mexico" policy (Migrant Protection Protocols), requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were processed.   
Reductions in the number of refugees allowed into the United States.   
Travel Bans:
Implementation of travel restrictions on individuals from several predominantly Muslim countries.
