Resolutions Related to Poverty
Addressing poverty is a global priority, with various international organizations and summits focusing on eradicating poverty in all its forms. Here are some key resolutions and initiatives related to poverty eradication:

United Nations Initiatives:

The United Nations has long been committed to ending poverty, with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aiming to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. However, current progress suggests that more than 600 million people may still live in extreme poverty by that deadline47.
The UN's Division for Social Policy and Development (DSPD) supports governments in implementing commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen, which identified poverty eradication as a core issue47.
Summit on Poverty:

The Social Development Commission's 2023 Summit on Poverty marked 60 years of fighting poverty. The summit aimed to reflect on progress and chart innovative solutions to break the cycle of poverty. It emphasized the importance of diverse perspectives and collective efforts in addressing poverty48.
American Psychological Association (APA) Resolutions:

The APA has highlighted the impact of poverty on mental health and called for policies that address the root causes of poverty. Poverty is linked to substandard housing, hunger, and inadequate access to education and healthcare, which exacerbate mental health issues49.
United Nations General Assembly Resolutions:

The General Assembly has adopted several resolutions aimed at poverty eradication, including those focusing on the role of microcredit and microfinance in alleviating poverty. These resolutions emphasize the need for coordinated efforts and financial support for developing countries50.
The Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) was proclaimed to emphasize the global challenge of poverty eradication and the need for sustainable development51.
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030 is a pivotal goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $2.15 per day, has seen significant reductions, but the COVID-19 pandemic reversed some of these gains52.
The SDGs aim to build resilience among the poor and reduce their vulnerability to climate-related events and other shocks. Achieving these goals requires mobilizing resources and enhancing development cooperation52.
Global Goals:

The Global Goals initiative emphasizes the importance of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere. This aligns with the broader UN agenda to combat inequalities and ensure that no one is left behind53
