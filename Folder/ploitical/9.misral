Refugee Rights in Europe
Refugee rights in Europe are governed by a combination of international conventions, EU regulations, and national laws. Here are some key aspects and challenges related to refugee rights in Europe:

Legal Framework:

The 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the foundational international agreements that define refugee status and rights. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees the right to asylum and subsidiary protection for individuals who do not qualify for refugee status but face serious risks in their home countries6566.
The EU has established a common European asylum policy, which includes procedures for granting asylum and ensuring fair and effective processes across member states. The EU's asylum policy aims to address challenges related to migration management and ensure the protection of refugees' rights65.
Challenges and Issues:

Despite the legal frameworks, refugees and migrants in Europe face significant challenges, including pushbacks, poor reception conditions, and restrictive policies. Reports indicate that migrants and refugees are often mistreated by law enforcement officials and denied access to asylum procedures, which violates international human rights law6768.
The situation has been exacerbated by political tensions and the use of refugees as pawns in geopolitical conflicts. For example, the increase in arrivals at the Greece-Turkey border highlighted the urgent need for the EU to adopt an approach grounded in respect for human rights67.
Advocacy and Support:

Non-profit organizations and advocacy groups play a crucial role in filling data gaps, advocating for refugees' rights, and challenging structural issues through evidence-based advocacy. These organizations work to hold governments accountable for their human rights obligations and support court cases to protect refugees' rights6970.
The European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) is an alliance of NGOs that aims to protect and advance the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, and displaced persons in Europe. ECRE's mission includes influencing government policy and practice affecting refugee rights both within Europe and in Europe's external actions70.
Current Situation:

The situation of migrants in Europe has deteriorated, marked by deaths, poor reception conditions, and restrictive policies. The Commissioner for Human Rights focuses on improving the rights of migrants in line with states' obligations under human rights law, including access to asylum and essential services71.
The UNHCR works to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless persons in Europe. The organization provides guidance, training, and support to governments across Europe to promote the best international standards in legislation, policy, and procedures72.
