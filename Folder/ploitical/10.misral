UN Resolutions on Health Care
The United Nations (UN) and its member states have adopted several resolutions aimed at improving health care globally. These resolutions address various aspects of health care, including access to medicines, primary health care, and universal health coverage. Here are some key resolutions and their implications:

Improving Transparency of Markets for Medicines:

The World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted a resolution to improve the transparency of markets for medicines, vaccines, and other health products. This resolution aims to expand access to these products by increasing transparency on actual prices paid by governments and other buyers, which can help countries make more informed decisions when purchasing health products and negotiating affordable prices73.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC):

The WHA agreed on four resolutions related to universal health care, addressing primary health care, the role of community health workers, emergency care systems, and the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting on UHC. These resolutions emphasize the importance of strengthening primary health care systems, supporting community health workers, and improving emergency care services to achieve universal health coverage7475.
The resolutions call on Member States to take steps to implement the Declaration of Astana, which was adopted at the 2018 Global Conference on Primary Health Care. The Declaration recognizes the key role of primary health care in ensuring that countries can provide a full range of health services throughout a person's life75.
UNGA High-Level Meeting on UHC:

The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for all people to have equal access to health services and agreeing to hold a high-level meeting on universal health coverage in 2019. This resolution emphasizes the importance of universal health coverage in promoting healthier populations and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals76.
Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021-2030):

The General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring 2021-2030 as the United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing. This resolution aims to address the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on older persons and ensure that health-care decisions affecting them respect their dignity and promote their human rights77.
Strengthening Action on HIV/AIDS:

The UN has adopted resolutions to expand access to information, treatment, health care, and social services for people living with HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne diseases. These resolutions aim to strengthen monitoring, evaluation, and reporting systems to better address the needs of affected populations78.
Integrating Ear and Hearing Care:

A new resolution calls on governments to integrate strategies for ear and hearing care within the framework of their primary health care systems. This resolution emphasizes the importance of establishing training programs for health workers, implementing prevention and screening programs for high-risk populations, and improving access to affordable, cost-effective, high-quality hearing technologies and products79.
