Donald Trump's immigration policies focused on stricter enforcement, border security, and reducing both legal and illegal immigration. Here are some key aspects of his approach:

Border Security & Enforcement
Border Wall: Expanded barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Remain in Mexico Policy (MPP): Required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings.

Title 42 Expulsions: Used a public health rule to rapidly expel migrants during COVID-19.

Zero Tolerance Policy: Led to family separations at the border by prosecuting all illegal crossings.

Increased ICE Raids: More workplace and community immigration enforcement actions.

Legal Immigration Restrictions
Travel Bans: Restricted immigration from several Muslim-majority countries.

Public Charge Rule: Made it harder for immigrants using public benefits to get green cards.

Cuts to Refugee Admissions: Lowered the annual refugee cap to record lows.

DACA Threats: Tried to end protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

H-1B Visa Reforms: Made it harder for skilled foreign workers to obtain work visas.
