It seems like you're asking about the "GSUMIIT Resolution" related to poverty, but there might be a misunderstanding or confusion about the term "GSUMIIT." As of now, there is no widely recognized "GSUMIIT Resolution" in the context of poverty or other global issues.

However, if you're referring to global resolutions or initiatives related to poverty, there are several prominent frameworks and agreements that address poverty reduction on an international level. I can highlight some of the key ones:

1. United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The United Nations (UN) established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which include Goal 1: End Poverty in All Its Forms Everywhere. This is one of the 17 goals aiming to improve the quality of life and tackle global issues by 2030.

Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Target: By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.

There are multiple targets under this goal, focusing on ensuring equal access to resources, improving social protection, and addressing vulnerabilities to extreme poverty.

The SDGs are a comprehensive framework supported by countries worldwide to reduce poverty and inequality.

2. World Bank Resolutions and Programs
The World Bank plays a significant role in addressing poverty globally. It provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries for projects aimed at reducing poverty and fostering economic development.

Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs): These are country-led strategies prepared by governments to reduce poverty, typically in collaboration with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Global Poverty Goals: The World Bank has set ambitious targets for reducing global poverty, aiming to reduce the percentage of people living in extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 per day) to 3% by 2030.

3. International Labor Organization (ILO) and Poverty
The International Labor Organization (ILO), a UN agency, addresses poverty through its work on promoting fair labor standards and decent work conditions worldwide.

Decent Work Agenda: The ILOâ€™s initiatives focus on ensuring that work is decent, productive, and provides a living wage, which is key to lifting people out of poverty.

The ILO emphasizes the importance of social protection, education, and empowerment to help individuals escape the cycle of poverty.

4. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change
While the Paris Agreement (2015) is primarily focused on combating climate change, it also has indirect links to poverty reduction. Climate change disproportionately affects the poor, especially in developing countries, so policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change are seen as critical to preventing further poverty.
