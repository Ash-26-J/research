Climate Change Policies in India
India has implemented various policies and initiatives to address climate change, aiming to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability. Here are some key aspects of India's climate change policies:

National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC):

Launched in 2008, the NAPCC outlines eight national missions to address climate change, focusing on areas such as solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, and water management14.
Renewable Energy Targets:

India has set ambitious targets for renewable energy, aiming to achieve 50% of its electricity capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. However, the current policies are considered "Highly Insufficient" in meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit, and stronger targets are needed to drive actual emissions reductions15.
Emissions and Energy Consumption:

India's emissions are projected to be around 4.0-4.3 GtCO2e by 2030 under current policies. The transport sector, dominated by fossil fuels, is a significant contributor to emissions. Efforts are being made to increase the share of electricity in transport to reduce emissions16.
Per capita building-related emissions in India are low compared to the G20 average, but energy consumption in residential buildings is expected to rise significantly by 2050, necessitating energy-efficiency strategies16.
Adaptation and Resilience:

India has allocated $55.6 million for the National Adaptation Fund to support climate-sensitive sectors like forestry. The country is also working on greening the railway system, reducing single-use plastic, and producing clean cooking fuel17.
Mumbai aims to become South Asia’s first zero-carbon city by 2050, showcasing India's commitment to urban sustainability18.
International Cooperation:

India is actively engaged in international climate negotiations and has implemented various policies to improve energy efficiency, develop clean energy sources, and prepare for the impacts of climate change. The country is also involved in bilateral cooperation schemes with countries like Switzerland, Germany, and the USA to advance climate research and technology14.
Climate Change Policies Abroad
Globally, countries are implementing various policies to combat climate change, with some notable examples and frameworks:

United States:

The Biden administration has prioritized climate action, integrating climate considerations into foreign policy and national security. The U.S. aims to lead global efforts to achieve a sustainable climate pathway and build resilience against climate impacts both domestically and internationally192021.
European Union:

The EU is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2050, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to a net-zero economy. The European Green Deal is a comprehensive plan to make the EU's economy sustainable and climate-neutral22.
The EU also engages in international climate action, working with non-EU countries to promote global climate efforts and support the Paris Agreement's goals23.
Global Climate Action:

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main international treaty addressing climate change. Countries worldwide are developing frameworks and laws to mitigate and adapt to climate change, with Denmark, Sweden, and Chile leading in climate action2423.
The World Bank's Reality Check report highlights successful climate policies from various countries, showcasing real-world results and the compromises required for effective implementation25.
Inflation Reduction Act:

The Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. sets the stage for significant climate and clean energy leadership, focusing on accelerating the energy transition and increasing infrastructure resilience26.
