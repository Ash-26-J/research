Main Cause of Porphyria
Porphyria is a group of rare disorders caused by problems with the production of heme, a vital component of hemoglobin (the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen). The main cause is:

Genetic Mutations
Most types of porphyria are inherited.

Mutations in specific genes affect enzymes involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway.

These enzyme defects lead to a buildup of porphyrins or precursors, which can be toxic.

Types of Porphyria and Triggers
There are two main categories:

1. Acute Porphyrias
Affects the nervous system.

Triggered by:

Certain medications

Fasting or dieting

Stress or infections

Hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation)

Alcohol

2. Cutaneous Porphyrias
Affects the skin.

Triggered by:

Sunlight exposure

Iron overload (in some types)

Alcohol or smoking
