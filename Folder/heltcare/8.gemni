The prevalence of Hemophilia B in the general population is approximately 1 in 40,000 males.

Here's a breakdown to give you a better understanding:

Percentage of Hemophilia Cases: Hemophilia B accounts for about 15-20% of all cases of hemophilia. Hemophilia A is much more common, making up the majority of cases.   
Inheritance Pattern: Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder. This means the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome.
Males (XY) will have hemophilia B if they inherit one affected X chromosome.   
Females (XX) typically need to inherit two affected X chromosomes (one from each parent) to have symptomatic hemophilia B, which is rarer. However, females who carry one affected X chromosome are called carriers and can sometimes experience mild to moderate bleeding symptoms themselves (estimated in 10-25% of carriers).   
  
Global Estimates: While the overall prevalence of hemophilia (A and B combined) is estimated to be around 1 in 5,000 males, Hemophilia B is significantly less common.
Underdiagnosis: Some research suggests that hemophilia, including type B, might be underdiagnosed worldwide.   
Therefore, while the exact percentage of the total global population with Hemophilia B is very small (around 0.0025% of males), it's more accurate to state that Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 out of every 40,000 males and represents about 15-20% of all hemophilia cases.
