Early Symptoms of Prostate Issues
Prostate problems are common in men, especially as they age. Early signs can point to different conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, or prostate cancer. Here are the key early symptoms to look out for:

1. Urinary Problems
Frequent need to urinate (especially at night)

Difficulty starting or stopping urination

Weak or interrupted urine stream

Feeling of incomplete bladder emptying

Urgent need to urinate

Dribbling after urination

2. Pain or Discomfort
Pain or burning during urination (often with prostatitis)

Pain in the lower back, hips, or pelvis

3. Sexual Function Changes
Painful ejaculation

Erectile difficulties (sometimes linked to prostate issues)

4. Blood in Urine or Semen
Can be a sign of inflammation or, in some cases, cancer

When to See a Doctor:
Even mild symptoms should be checked, especially if you're over 50. Early detection of prostate problems can help prevent complications.
