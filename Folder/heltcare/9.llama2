Types of Hemophilia
Hemophilia A
1. Classic hemophilia: Caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII
2. Prevalence: 1 in 5,000 live males
3. Symptoms: Bleeding into joints, muscles, and soft tissues

Hemophilia B
1. Christmas disease: Caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX
2. Prevalence: 1 in 40,000 live males
3. Symptoms: Similar to hemophilia A, with bleeding into joints, muscles, and soft tissues

Hemophilia C
1. Factor XI deficiency: Caused by a deficiency of clotting factor XI
2. Prevalence: 1 in 100,000 live births
3. Symptoms: Milder bleeding symptoms compared to hemophilia A and B

Other Types of Hemophilia
1. Hemophilia A carriers: Female carriers of the hemophilia A gene may experience mild bleeding symptoms
2. Acquired hemophilia: A rare condition caused by the development of antibodies against clotting factors
3. Hemophilia with inhibitors: Some people with hemophilia develop inhibitors, which are antibodies that neutralize the effect of clotting factor replacement therapy

Severity Levels
Hemophilia can be classified into different severity levels based on the level of clotting factor activity:

1. Mild hemophilia: Clotting factor activity between 5% and 40% of normal
2. Moderate hemophilia: Clotting factor activity between 1% and 5% of normal
3. Severe hemophilia: Clotting factor activity below 1% of normal
