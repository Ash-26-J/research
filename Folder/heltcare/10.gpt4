You're asking about amoeba infection, most likely referring to amoebiasis, which is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. It's a gut infection that can be mild or, in some cases, seriously invasive.

🦠 Cause of Amoebiasis (Amoeba Infection):
Parasite: Entamoeba histolytica

Transmission: Fecal-oral route — most commonly through:

Contaminated food or water

Poor sanitation

Unwashed hands

Found more in tropical regions, crowded living conditions, or places with poor hygiene

⚠️ Initial / Early Symptoms:
These usually show up 1–4 weeks after exposure but can vary.

✅ Mild to Moderate Cases:
Loose stools or mild diarrhea

Abdominal cramps

Gas or bloating

Fatigue

Urgent need to defecate

🔥 As it progresses (in more serious cases):
Dysentery: frequent, bloody diarrhea

Severe abdominal pain

Fever

Weight loss

Nausea

💣 If untreated:
In rare but dangerous cases, the amoeba can invade the intestinal wall or spread to other organs, causing:

Liver abscess (right upper abdominal pain, fever, enlarged liver)

Peritonitis (if the intestine perforates)

🛑 Important Note:
Many people infected with E. histolytica may not show any symptoms, but they can still spread the parasite.
