Asthma is a chronic condition that affects the airways, causing them to become inflamed and narrow, leading to difficulty breathing. Here are the common symptoms and causes of asthma:

Symptoms of Asthma:
Shortness of Breath: Difficulty breathing, especially during physical activity or at night.

Wheezing: A whistling or squeaky sound when breathing, particularly when exhaling.

Chest Tightness: A feeling of pressure or constriction in the chest.

Coughing: Persistent coughing, often worse at night or early in the morning.

Fatigue: Feeling tired, often due to difficulty breathing or lack of sleep.

Rapid Breathing: Breathing faster than normal, especially during an asthma attack.

Difficulty Sleeping: Waking up frequently due to coughing or wheezing.

Causes of Asthma:
Genetic Factors: A family history of asthma or allergies can increase the risk.

Allergens: Exposure to substances like pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or mold can trigger asthma symptoms.

Respiratory Infections: Viral infections, such as the common cold or flu, can exacerbate asthma.

Air Pollutants: Exposure to smoke, pollution, or chemical fumes can irritate the airways.

Exercise: Physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms in some people, known as exercise-induced asthma.

Weather Conditions: Cold air, humidity, or sudden changes in weather can affect asthma.

Occupational Factors: Exposure to certain substances in the workplace, such as chemicals or dust, can lead to occupational asthma.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Acid reflux can worsen asthma symptoms.

Obesity: Being overweight can increase the risk of developing asthma.

Stress and Emotions: Strong emotions or stress can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals.
