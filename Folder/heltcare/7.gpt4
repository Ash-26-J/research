Porphyria is a group of rare disorders caused by problems in the bodyâ€™s heme productionâ€”thatâ€™s the stuff your body uses to make hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying part of red blood cells). The main cause of porphyria is:

ðŸ”¬ A genetic mutation affecting enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway.
ðŸ§¬ So, to break it down:
Heme is made through a series of steps involving enzymes.

In porphyria, one of those enzymes is missing or doesnâ€™t work properly due to a gene mutation.

This causes a buildup of porphyrins or their precursors, which are toxic at high levels.

ðŸ’¥ Main Types (and What Builds Up):
Type of Porphyria	Cause (Deficient Enzyme)	Triggers	Main Symptoms
Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)	Porphobilinogen deaminase	Meds, hormones, fasting, stress	Abdominal pain, nerve issues
Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)	Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase	Alcohol, iron, hepatitis C	Blistering skin in sunlight
Hereditary Coproporphyria (HCP)	Coproporphyrinogen oxidase	Similar triggers to AIP	Mixed neuro & skin symptoms
Variegate Porphyria (VP)	Protoporphyrinogen oxidase	Same	Skin + neurological problems
ðŸŽ¯ Main Causes/Triggers (especially for acute attacks):
Genetics (inherited enzyme mutation)

Certain medications (like barbiturates, sulfa drugs)

Hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation)

Fasting or dieting

Alcohol

Smoking

Stress

Infections
