The symptoms of lymphoma, a cancer that begins in white blood cells called lymphocytes, can vary depending on the type of lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin) and where it is in the body. However, some common signs and symptoms include:

Common Symptoms:

Painless swelling of lymph nodes: This is the most common symptom and can occur in the neck, armpits, groin, or other areas. The swelling is usually painless but can sometimes ache or cause pressure.
Persistent fatigue: Feeling unusually tired or exhausted, even after rest.
Unexplained weight loss: Losing a significant amount of weight without trying (10% or more of body weight over 6 months).
Night sweats: Drenching sweats that soak your clothes and bedding.
Fever: Recurrent or persistent fever without a known infection.
Itchy skin (pruritus): Generalized itching all over the body or in specific areas.
Other Possible Symptoms (depending on the location of the lymphoma):

Coughing, chest pain, or shortness of breath: If lymph nodes in the chest are affected.
Abdominal pain or swelling, feeling full quickly: If lymphoma affects lymph nodes or organs in the abdomen.
Headaches, difficulty concentrating, weakness, or seizures: In rare cases where lymphoma affects the brain or spinal cord.
Skin rashes or lumps: With certain types of lymphoma that affect the skin.
Frequent infections: Due to a weakened immune system.
Easy bruising or bleeding: In some cases, if the bone marrow is affected.
Important Considerations:

Many of these symptoms can also be caused by other, less serious conditions, such as infections. However, if you experience any of these symptoms persistently or they worsen, it's crucial to see a doctor to determine the cause.
The presence of "B symptoms" (fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss) is often used in staging lymphoma and can indicate a more active disease.
Symptoms of lymphoma can be similar in men and women. However, in women, some symptoms like fatigue or abdominal discomfort might be mistakenly attributed to other conditions like premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or menopause.
When to See a Doctor:

It is recommended to see a doctor if you have any persistent or concerning symptoms, especially:

Swollen lymph nodes that don't go away after a few weeks.
Unexplained fever, night sweats, or weight loss.
Persistent fatigue that interferes with daily activities.
A doctor can perform a physical exam, order blood tests, and potentially recommend a lymph node biopsy or imaging tests to determine if lymphoma is the cause of your symptoms. Early detection and diagnosis are important for effective treatment.
