A kidney infection (aka pyelonephritis) is a serious UTI (urinary tract infection) that travels up to the kidneys. It can get dangerous if untreated—so knowing the symptoms and how to treat it is super important.

⚠️ Symptoms of a Kidney Infection:
✅ Common signs:
Fever and chills

Flank pain (pain in the back or side, usually one-sided)

Painful or burning urination

Frequent urge to pee

Cloudy, dark, or foul-smelling urine

Blood in the urine

Nausea and vomiting

Fatigue or weakness

🚨 In more severe cases:
High fever (over 101°F / 38.5°C)

Confusion (especially in elderly patients)

Sepsis (if the infection enters the bloodstream—life-threatening)

💊 Cure / Treatment:
🔹 1. Antibiotics (first line)
Oral antibiotics for mild cases (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)

IV antibiotics for severe cases (especially if hospitalized)

Usually taken for 7–14 days

🔹 2. Hospitalization (if needed)
For severe symptoms, dehydration, or inability to take meds by mouth

IV fluids + IV antibiotics

🔹 3. Pain and fever management
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen for fever/pain

🛑 What NOT to do:
Don’t ignore symptoms thinking it’s “just a bladder infection”—kidney infections can damage the kidney permanently if untreated.

Avoid self-medicating without seeing a doctor.

🛡️ Prevention Tips:
Stay hydrated—flush bacteria out

Pee after sex (helps clear the urethra)

Don’t hold in urine

Wipe front to back (especially for women)

Treat bladder infections early to prevent spread
