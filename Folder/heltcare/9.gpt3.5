Hemophilia is a group of rare bleeding disorders where the blood doesn't clot properly due to missing or defective clotting factors. There are three main types:

1. Hemophilia A (Classic Hemophilia)
Cause: Deficiency or absence of clotting factor VIII

Most common type – about 80-85% of all hemophilia cases

Symptoms: Easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, joint bleeds

2. Hemophilia B (Christmas Disease)
Cause: Deficiency or absence of clotting factor IX

Named after the first patient diagnosed, Stephen Christmas

Accounts for about 15-20% of hemophilia cases

Symptoms are similar to Hemophilia A

3. Hemophilia C (Rosenthal Syndrome)
Cause: Deficiency of clotting factor XI

Much milder and less common

Can affect both males and females

More common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent

Rare or Acquired Forms
Acquired Hemophilia
Not inherited – caused by the immune system attacking clotting factors (usually factor VIII)

Can occur in adults with autoimmune diseases, cancer, or during pregnancy
