A kidney infection, also known as pyelonephritis, is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that specifically affects one or both kidneys. It's a more serious condition than a bladder infection (cystitis) and requires prompt medical attention.

Symptoms of Kidney Infection:

Symptoms can develop quickly over a few hours or days and may include:

Pain:
Pain in your side, back, or groin (often in the flank area, just below the ribs).
Pain may be dull, aching, or severe.
Fever and Chills: A high temperature (100.4°F or 38°C and above) and shivering are common.
Feeling Sick: Nausea and vomiting.
Changes in Urination:
Frequent urge to urinate.
Pain or burning sensation when urinating (dysuria).
Cloudy, dark, or bloody urine (hematuria).
Foul-smelling urine.
General Malaise: Feeling very weak or tired.
Loss of Appetite.
Diarrhea.
In young children, symptoms may be less specific and can include:

High fever.
Irritability.
Poor feeding.
Vomiting.
Lethargy (drowsiness).
Bedwetting (in previously dry children).
Cure of Kidney Infection:

The primary treatment for a kidney infection is antibiotics.

Antibiotics: Your doctor will prescribe a course of antibiotics, usually taken orally for 7 to 14 days, depending on the severity of the infection and the specific bacteria identified (if a urine culture is done). Common antibiotics used include ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, cephalexin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. It's crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better, to ensure the infection is fully eradicated1 and to prevent antibiotic resistance.

Pain Relief: Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (paracetamol) can help manage pain and fever. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are generally not recommended unless advised by a doctor, as they may increase the risk of further kidney problems.
Hydration: Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, helps to flush bacteria out of the urinary system and prevents dehydration.
Rest: Getting enough rest allows your body to focus on fighting the infection.
In more severe cases or if complications arise, hospitalization may be necessary for:

Intravenous (IV) Antibiotics: Antibiotics are administered directly into a vein for faster and more effective treatment.
Fluid Management: IV fluids may be given to treat dehydration.
Monitoring: Closer monitoring of vital signs and kidney function.
Recovery:

You should start to feel better within a few days of starting antibiotics.
Most people recover fully from a kidney infection within about two weeks.
Follow-up urine tests may be done to ensure the infection has cleared.
Important Considerations:

Seek Medical Attention Promptly: If you suspect you have a kidney infection, it's crucial to see a doctor as soon as possible. Untreated kidney infections can lead to serious complications, such as kidney scarring, chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure, and sepsis (blood poisoning), which can be life-threatening.
Follow Doctor's Instructions: Take all medications exactly as prescribed and complete the full course.
Don't Delay Urination: Empty your bladder fully and regularly.
Hygiene: Practice good hygiene to prevent UTIs, which can lead to kidney infections. Women should wipe from front to back after using the toilet.
Stay Hydrated Regularly: Drinking enough fluids daily helps prevent UTIs.
