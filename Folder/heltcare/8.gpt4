Hemophilia B is a rare genetic bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor IX. It's sometimes called “Christmas disease” (named after the first patient diagnosed, not the holiday 😄).

📊 Prevalence:
Hemophilia B affects about 1 in 25,000 male births worldwide.

It accounts for about 15–20% of all hemophilia cases (the rest are mostly Hemophilia A, which involves factor VIII).

👥 In terms of population:
Globally: Rough estimate is about 3–5 people per 100,000 males.

Because it’s X-linked, it mostly affects males. Females are usually carriers, but in rare cases can also have symptoms.

🌍 Example Numbers:
If you had a city of 1 million people (about half male), you'd expect:

~20 males with Hemophilia B

Possibly a few female carriers with mild symptoms
