Cure and Treatment
A kidney infection requires prompt treatment. Here’s how it’s usually managed:

1. Antibiotics
Primary treatment – prescribed based on the type of bacteria.

Oral antibiotics for mild cases, IV antibiotics for severe or hospitalized cases.

2. Pain and Fever Management
Over-the-counter meds like acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if kidney function is normal).

3. Hydration
Drink plenty of water to help flush bacteria out of the urinary system.

4. Hospitalization (in severe cases)
If the infection is severe, causes vomiting, or affects kidney function, hospital care may be needed.

5. Surgery (rare)
Needed if there's an obstruction like a kidney stone or abscess.
