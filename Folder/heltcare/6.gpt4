Great question—early prostate issues can sneak up slowly, so catching the signs early can make a big difference. Not all symptoms mean cancer; many are due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate, especially common as men age.

🔍 Early Symptoms of Prostate Problems:
🛑 Urinary Symptoms (the most common early signs):
Frequent urge to urinate, especially at night (nocturia)

Difficulty starting urination (hesitancy)

Weak or interrupted urine stream

Dribbling at the end of urination

Feeling like the bladder isn’t empty, even after going

Straining to urinate

Sudden, strong urge to pee (urgency)

🩸 Other possible signs:
Pain or burning during urination

Blood in urine or semen (less common, needs immediate checkup)

Painful ejaculation

Discomfort in the pelvic area, lower back, or hips

🧠 Possible Causes of These Symptoms:
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) – most common cause in older men

Prostatitis – inflammation or infection of the prostate (can happen at any age)

Prostate cancer – often silent early on but can share symptoms with BPH

🧪 When to Get Checked:
If you're noticing any urinary changes, especially after age 40–50, it’s smart to:

Get a prostate exam (digital rectal exam or DRE)

Check PSA levels (Prostate-Specific Antigen blood test)

Consider ultrasound or MRI if needed
