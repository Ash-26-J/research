High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is usually related to problems with insulin, a hormone that helps regulate glucose in the blood. Here are the main causes:

1. Diabetes
Type 1 Diabetes – the body doesn’t produce insulin.

Type 2 Diabetes – the body doesn’t use insulin properly (insulin resistance).

2. Diet
Eating too many carbohydrates or sugary foods.

Skipping or irregular timing of diabetes medications or insulin.

3. Lack of Physical Activity
Inactivity reduces insulin effectiveness.

4. Stress
Physical or emotional stress increases hormones that can raise blood sugar.

5. Illness or Infection
Being sick causes your body to release stress hormones, which can raise glucose levels.

6. Medications
Some drugs like steroids, diuretics, and certain psychiatric medications can raise blood sugar.

7. Hormonal Conditions
Disorders like Cushing’s syndrome or hyperthyroidism can interfere with insulin and glucose levels.
