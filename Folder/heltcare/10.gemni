The term "amoeba" can refer to several different single-celled organisms (protozoa) that can cause various health issues. To provide a comprehensive answer, let's discuss the most common and well-known amoebic infection: Amebiasis, caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica.   

Cause of Amebiasis
Amebiasis is caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. The primary way this parasite spreads is through the fecal-oral route. This means that the cysts (the dormant, infective form of the parasite) present in the feces of an infected person are ingested by another person, usually through:   

Contaminated food and water: This is the most common mode of transmission. Water can be contaminated by sewage, and food can be contaminated by infected food handlers who don't wash their hands properly or by using contaminated water for washing or irrigation.
Poor sanitation and hygiene: In areas with poor sanitation, fecal contamination of the environment is more likely, increasing the risk of transmission.   
Direct contact with feces: This can occur through activities like anal sex or inadequate handwashing after using the toilet or changing diapers.   
Flies and cockroaches: These insects can act as mechanical carriers, transferring cysts from feces to food.   
Once the cysts are ingested, they travel to the digestive system. In the small intestine, they develop into their active, feeding form called trophozoites. These trophozoites then move to the large intestine, where they can multiply and either remain harmlessly or invade the intestinal wall, causing illness. Some trophozoites can also form new cysts, which are then passed in the feces, continuing the cycle of infection.   

Initial Symptoms of Amebiasis
It's important to note that most people infected with Entamoeba histolytica (around 90%) do not develop any symptoms. They become asymptomatic carriers, meaning they harbor the parasite and can still shed cysts in their stool, potentially infecting others.   

When symptoms do occur, they can range from mild to severe and typically develop within 2 to 4 weeks after ingestion of the cysts, although they can appear sooner or later in some cases. Initial symptoms of amebiasis can include:   

Mild diarrhea: This may consist of loose, watery stools and can come and go.   
Abdominal pain and cramping: Discomfort in the stomach area.   
Nausea: A feeling of sickness in the stomach.   
Loss of appetite: Feeling less hungry than usual.
Fatigue: Feeling tired and lacking energy.   
Weight loss: Unintentional decrease in body weight over time.
In some cases, the infection can become more severe, leading to amoebic dysentery. Symptoms of amoebic dysentery include:   

Frequent and severe abdominal pain.   
Diarrhea with blood and mucus: This is a key indicator of intestinal invasion.   
Fever: An elevated body temperature.   
Vomiting.
In rare cases, the trophozoites can invade the bloodstream and spread to other organs, most commonly the liver, causing an amoebic liver abscess. Symptoms of a liver abscess can include:   

Pain in the upper right abdomen.   
Fever and chills.
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) may occur in some instances.   
It's crucial to consult a doctor if you experience persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, especially if you have recently traveled to an area with poor sanitation or have other risk factors for amebiasis.
