Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, which is part of your immune system. There are two main types—Hodgkin lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma—but their symptoms can overlap.

⚠️ Common Symptoms of Lymphoma:
🧅 1. Swollen Lymph Nodes (most classic sign)
Painless swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin

Nodes may feel rubbery or firm

🌡️ 2. “B Symptoms” (often signal a more aggressive or advanced case)
Fever (without infection)

Drenching night sweats

Unexplained weight loss (10%+ of body weight in 6 months)

💥 3. Fatigue
Extreme tiredness not relieved by rest

💨 4. Shortness of breath or cough
Especially if swollen lymph nodes are pressing on airways

🦴 5. Pain or fullness
In the chest or abdomen (from enlarged organs or nodes)

🌡️ 6. Itchy skin or rash
Especially in Hodgkin lymphoma

💉 7. Frequent infections
Because the immune system is compromised

🧬 Less Common / Unique Signs:
Alcohol-induced node pain (rare, but seen in Hodgkin lymphoma)

Swelling in legs or face (if lymphatic drainage is blocked)

Neurological symptoms (in rare types like CNS lymphoma)

🧪 How It's Diagnosed:
Blood tests (for abnormalities in white blood cells)

Imaging (CT, PET scan)

Lymph node biopsy (essential to confirm type)

Bone marrow biopsy (to see how far it's spread)
