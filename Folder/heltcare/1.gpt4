High blood pressure (aka hypertension) can sneak up on youâ€”itâ€™s often called the "silent killer" because it usually has no symptoms. But it definitely has causes. These can be split into two categories: primary (no clear cause) and secondary (linked to an underlying condition).

ðŸ§  Primary (Essential) Hypertension
This is the most common typeâ€”develops gradually over years. Causes are more lifestyle and genetics-based:

Genetics / family history

Aging (blood vessels stiffen over time)

High salt (sodium) intake

Obesity

Lack of physical activity

Stress

Smoking and alcohol

Poor diet (low potassium, high fat/sugar)

ðŸ§¬ Secondary Hypertension
This type has a direct cause and often appears more suddenly and severely.

Kidney disease (most common secondary cause)

Adrenal gland tumors (e.g., pheochromocytoma)

Thyroid problems

Sleep apnea

Certain medications (like birth control pills, NSAIDs, decongestants, some antidepressants)

Illegal drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines)

Congenital blood vessel defects (like coarctation of the aorta)

ðŸ‘€ Less common but interesting causes (House-style):
Cushingâ€™s syndrome â€“ too much cortisol

Hyperaldosteronism â€“ too much aldosterone â†’ sodium retention

Renovascular hypertension â€“ narrowed arteries in the kidneys

Licorice toxicity (yep, real black licorice can raise BP if eaten in big amounts)
