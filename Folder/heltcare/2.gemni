High blood sugar, also known as hyperglycemia, occurs when there is an excess of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream. This can happen for various reasons, with diabetes mellitus being the most common underlying cause. Here's a breakdown of the causes:   

In People with Diabetes:

Insufficient Insulin: In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body may not produce enough insulin or the body's cells may become resistant to the insulin produced (insulin resistance). Insulin is crucial for allowing glucose to enter cells for energy. Without enough effective insulin, glucose builds up in the blood.   
Dietary Factors: Consuming too many carbohydrates, especially simple sugars, can lead to a rapid increase in blood glucose levels. Not balancing food intake with insulin or other diabetes medications can also cause spikes.   
Lack of Physical Activity: Exercise helps the body use glucose for energy and makes cells more sensitive to insulin. Insufficient physical activity can contribute to higher blood sugar levels.   
Illness and Stress: When the body is under stress due to illness, injury, or emotional factors, it releases hormones that can raise blood sugar levels.   
Medications: Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, some diuretics, and some psychiatric drugs, can increase blood sugar levels.   
Dehydration: When the body is dehydrated, blood sugar can become more concentrated.   
Dawn Phenomenon: This is a natural rise in blood sugar that occurs in the early morning hours due to the release of hormones. People with diabetes may experience a more pronounced effect.   
Incorrect Medication Dosage or Timing: Not taking diabetes medications as prescribed, taking the wrong dose, or injecting insulin improperly or using expired insulin can lead to high blood sugar.   
In People Without Diabetes (Less Common):

Stress-Induced Hyperglycemia: Severe stress due to critical illness, surgery, or trauma can temporarily elevate blood sugar levels.   
Certain Medical Conditions: Some endocrine disorders (like Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, and hyperthyroidism), pancreatic disorders (like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer), and certain infections can cause high blood sugar.   
Medications: As mentioned above, some medications can increase blood sugar even in individuals without diabetes.   
Gestational Diabetes: This develops during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that can lead to insulin resistance.   
In summary, high blood sugar is primarily caused by problems with insulin production or function, often related to diabetes.

 However, other factors like diet, physical activity, stress, illness, and certain medical conditions or medications can also play a significant role.
