Symptoms of Asthma
Asthma affects the airways in the lungs, causing them to become inflamed and narrow. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may come and go.

Common Symptoms:
Wheezing – a whistling sound when breathing

Shortness of breath

Chest tightness or pain

Coughing – especially at night, early morning, or during/after exercise

Trouble sleeping – due to coughing or breathing difficulty

Causes of Asthma
Asthma doesn’t have one single cause. It’s usually due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

1. Genetics
Family history of asthma or allergies increases risk.

2. Environmental Triggers
Allergens: pollen, dust mites, mold, pet dander

Irritants: smoke, air pollution, strong odors, chemical fumes

3. Respiratory Infections
Especially in early childhood, can contribute to asthma development.

4. Physical Activity
Exercise-induced asthma is triggered during or after exercise.

5. Weather Conditions
Cold air, changes in temperature, or high humidity.

6. Stress and Emotions
Intense emotions or stress can trigger symptoms.

7. Medications
Such as aspirin, NSAIDs, or beta-blockers (in sensitive individuals).
