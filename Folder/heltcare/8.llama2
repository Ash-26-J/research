Hemophilia B affects approximately 1 in 40,000 live males, accounting for about 15% of all hemophilia cases. This condition is also known as Christmas disease, named after the first patient described with the disorder ¹ ².

To put this into perspective, here's a breakdown of the prevalence of different types of hemophilia ¹ ³:
- Hemophilia B: 1 in 40,000 live males (about 15% of cases)
- Hemophilia A: 1 in 5,000 live males (about 85% of cases)
- Hemophilia C: 1 in 100,000 live births (about 1% of cases)

It's worth noting that hemophilia primarily affects males, although female carriers may experience mild symptoms. The condition is caused by genetic mutations affecting the production of clotting factors, and its prevalence is consistent across different ethnic groups ⁴.
