Cause of Amoeba (Amoebiasis)
Amoebiasis is an infection caused by a parasite called Entamoeba histolytica. It's most commonly spread through:

Main Causes:
Drinking or eating contaminated water or food

Poor sanitation and hygiene

Direct contact with fecal matter (e.g., unwashed hands)

Contaminated fruits or vegetables

Transmission can also happen through sexual contact, especially involving oral-anal activity

Initial Symptoms of Amoebiasis
Many people infected with E. histolytica may have no symptoms. But when symptoms do appear, especially in intestinal amoebiasis, they can include:

Mild to Early Symptoms:
Abdominal pain or cramping

Loose stools or diarrhea

Fatigue

Flatulence (gas)

Mucus in stool

If the Infection Progresses:
Bloody diarrhea (dysentery)

Fever

Weight loss

Dehydration

In rare cases, the parasite can spread outside the intestines to the liver, causing an amoebic liver abscess â€” symptoms then include high fever, pain in the upper right abdomen, and enlarged liver.
