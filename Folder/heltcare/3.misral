Pain in the Back, Side, or Groin: This pain can be severe and is often felt on one side.
Nausea and Vomiting: Some people may experience digestive upset.
Frequent Urination: The need to urinate more often than usual.
Pain or Burning During Urination: Discomfort when passing urine.
Cloudy or Strong-Smelling Urine: Changes in the appearance or smell of urine.
Blood in Urine: Sometimes visible, but often microscopic and detected through testing.
Fatigue: Feeling tired or weak.
Treatment of Kidney Infection:
Antibiotics: The primary treatment for kidney infections is a course of antibiotics. The type and duration will depend on the severity of the infection and the bacteria causing it.

Pain Relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage discomfort.

Hydration: Drinking plenty of fluids helps flush bacteria out of the urinary tract.

Hospitalization: In severe cases, hospitalization may be required for intravenous antibiotics and fluids.

Follow-Up: It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics and follow up with a healthcare provider to ensure the infection has cleared.
