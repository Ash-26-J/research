The main cause of porphyria is a defect in one of the enzymes involved in the production of heme. Heme is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It's also found in other proteins in the body.   

The process of making heme involves eight different enzymes. If one of these enzymes is deficient or not functioning correctly due to an inherited genetic mutation, certain chemicals called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors can build up in the body. This accumulation leads to the various symptoms associated with porphyria.   

Here's a breakdown of the main points:

Genetic Basis: Most forms of porphyria are inherited, meaning they are caused by a change (mutation) in a gene passed down from one or both parents.   
Enzyme Deficiency: Each type of porphyria is linked to a deficiency in a specific enzyme within the heme production pathway.   
Porphyrin Buildup: The faulty enzyme causes an overproduction and accumulation of porphyrins or their precursors in different parts of the body, such as the liver, bone marrow, blood, and skin.   
Types of Porphyria: There are different types of porphyria, each characterized by a specific enzyme deficiency and the type of porphyrins that accumulate. These types are often broadly classified as:
Acute Porphyrias: Primarily affect the nervous system, causing attacks of severe abdominal pain, neurological issues (like muscle weakness, seizures, and mental changes), and sometimes psychiatric symptoms.   
Cutaneous Porphyrias: Primarily affect the skin, causing sensitivity to sunlight, leading to blisters, itching, redness, swelling, and scarring. Some cutaneous porphyrias may also involve the nervous system.   
  
While the underlying cause is usually genetic, certain environmental factors or triggers can exacerbate symptoms or trigger attacks in individuals with a genetic predisposition. These triggers can include:   

Certain medications (including some hormones, barbiturates, and sulfa antibiotics)   
Alcohol consumption   
Smoking   
Hormonal changes (e.g., during the menstrual cycle)   
Fasting or low-carbohydrate diets   
Stress
Infections
Exposure to sunlight   
It's important to note that many people may inherit a gene mutation for porphyria but never develop symptoms. Other genetic and environmental factors often play a role in whether or not the condition manifests.
