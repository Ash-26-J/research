Types of Lymphoma
There are two main types of lymphoma:

2. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: A type of lymphoma that does not have Reed-Sternberg cells

Diagnosis
Diagnosis typically involves:

1. Physical examination: A doctor will perform a physical examination to check for swollen lymph nodes or other signs of illness
2. Imaging tests: Imaging tests, such as CT scans or PET scans, to visualize the lymph nodes and other affected areas
3. Biopsy: A biopsy to examine the tissue or cells for cancer
4. Blood tests: Blood tests to check for abnormal blood cells or other signs of illness

Treatment
Treatment for lymphoma depends on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the individual's overall health. Treatment options may include:

1. Chemotherapy: Medications to kill cancer cells
2. Radiation therapy: High-energy rays to kill cancer cells
3. Immunotherapy: Medications to stimulate the immune system to fight cancer
4. Targeted therapy: Medications to target specific cancer cells or proteins
5. Stem cell transplant: A procedure to replace damaged stem cells with healthy ones

It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
