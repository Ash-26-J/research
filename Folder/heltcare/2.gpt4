High blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, usually revolves around insulin—either the body doesn’t make enough, doesn’t use it effectively, or both. But like with most things in the body, it’s not always that simple.

Here’s a breakdown:

🩸 Main Causes of High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia):
✅ 1. Diabetes (Type 1 & 2)
Type 1 Diabetes: Autoimmune—body attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

Type 2 Diabetes: Body becomes insulin resistant, or doesn’t make enough insulin.

✅ 2. Pre-diabetes
Blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes (yet).

🔄 Other Common Triggers
Poor diet (high in carbs/sugar)

Not enough insulin or oral medication (for diabetics)

Skipping or delaying medication

Lack of physical activity

Stress (increases cortisol, which raises blood sugar)

Illness or infection (your body releases glucose to fight it)

Certain medications (like steroids, antipsychotics, or diuretics)

Hormonal conditions (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly)

Pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer (impairs insulin production)

🍭 Temporary spikes (not diabetes)
Eating a big sugary meal

Post-surgery or trauma

Acute stress

Sleep deprivation (affects insulin sensitivity)

🧪 Normal Ranges (for context):
Test	Normal	Prediabetes	Diabetes
Fasting Blood Sugar	< 100 mg/dL	100–125	126+
HbA1c	< 5.7%	5.7–6.4%	6.5%+
