Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot, leading to prolonged bleeding. There are several types of hemophilia, each characterized by a deficiency in specific clotting factors. Here are the main types:

Hemophilia A:

Cause: Deficiency in clotting factor VIII.
Also Known As: Classic hemophilia.
Prevalence: The most common type of hemophilia, affecting approximately 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 5,000 males worldwide 4.
Hemophilia B:

Cause: Deficiency in clotting factor IX.
Also Known As: Christmas disease.
Prevalence: Less common than hemophilia A, affecting about 1 in 20,000 males 4.
Hemophilia C:

Cause: Deficiency in clotting factor XI.
Prevalence: Rarer than types A and B, and more commonly affects individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent 5.
Symptoms: Often milder and may not require treatment unless surgery or specific medical procedures are involved 6.
Acquired Hemophilia:

Cause: An autoimmune disorder where the body produces antibodies against its own clotting factors, typically factor VIII.
Prevalence: Very rare and can develop at any age, often associated with other underlying health conditions such as autoimmune diseases or cancer 5.
