There are three main types of hemophilia:   

 Hemophilia A (Classic Hemophilia or Factor VIII Deficiency):   

This is the most common type, accounting for about 80% of all hemophilia cases.   
It is caused by a deficiency or lack of the blood clotting factor VIII.   
The prevalence of Hemophilia A is approximately 1 in 5,000 male births.
Hemophilia B (Christmas Disease or Factor IX Deficiency):

This is the second most common type, making up about 15-20% of hemophilia cases.
It is caused by a deficiency or lack of the blood clotting factor IX.   
The prevalence of Hemophilia B is approximately 1 in 40,000 male births. It is about four times less common than Hemophilia A.   
 Hemophilia C (Factor XI Deficiency or Rosenthal Syndrome):   

This is a much rarer form of hemophilia.   
It is caused by a deficiency or lack of the blood clotting factor XI.   
Unlike Hemophilia A and B, which are X-linked recessive disorders, Hemophilia C is primarily autosomal recessive, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to inherit the condition. It affects males and females equally.   
The prevalence of Hemophilia C is estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 people, but it is more common in certain populations, such as Ashkenazi Jews.   
Key Differences in Inheritance:

Hemophilia A and B: Are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The genes for factors VIII and IX are located on the X chromosome. This means males are more likely to be affected, while females can be carriers (having the gene but usually not showing severe symptoms). A female carrier has a 50% chance of passing the affected gene to her sons (who will have hemophilia) and a 50% chance of passing the carrier gene to her daughters.   
Hemophilia C: Is primarily autosomal recessive. The gene for factor XI is on chromosome 4. Both parents must pass on the mutated gene for a child to have Hemophilia C.   
The severity of hemophilia in all types can range from mild to severe, depending on the level of the specific clotting factor in the blood.
