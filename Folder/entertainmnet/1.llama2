The most complicated case in the Dr. House series is subjective, but some notable mentions include:

- House's self-inflicted experiment: He injected himself with nitroglycerin to cause a migraine headache, proving a rival's migraine cure was flawed. He later used LSD to offset the migraine and antidepressants to nullify the LSD's effects ¹.
- The bus crash case: House underwent hypnosis and overdosed on Alzheimer's medication to unlock memories lost after a bus crash, which put him into cardiac arrest ¹.
- The case of the dead muscle: House rejected amputation and instead suggested a procedure to bypass circulation around the dead muscle, resulting in intense pain and cardiac arrest ¹.
- The mysterious shooting: Jack Moriarty shot House in the abdomen and neck, leading to a complex and dramatic storyline ² ³ ⁴ ¹ ⁵ ⁶.

These cases showcase Dr. House's unorthodox methods and willingness to take risks, often pushing the boundaries of medical ethics.
