While it's challenging to get precise, universally agreed-upon figures for the highest number of tickets sold for a single film in India due to varying historical data collection and reporting methods, Sholay (1975) is very often cited as the film with the highest footfalls (number of tickets sold) in India.

Here's why Sholay is believed to hold this record:

Unprecedented Theatrical Run: Sholay had an exceptionally long and successful run in theaters across India, many of which were packed for extended periods.
Cultural Phenomenon: It became a massive cultural phenomenon, with iconic characters, dialogues, and music that resonated deeply with the audience. This led to repeat viewings by many.   
Estimates Vary: While exact figures are debated, estimates for Sholay's domestic ticket sales often range over 100 million tickets.
Other films often mentioned with high ticket sales include:

Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017): A modern blockbuster that also saw massive footfalls, estimated to be over 11 crore (110 million) in the last 20 years according to some reports.
Mughal-E-Azam (1960): Another classic that had a very long run and high ticket sales in its time. Some sources suggest it sold over 15 crore tickets worldwide during its run.
Mother India (1957): A highly successful and influential film with significant footfalls.
Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994): A major hit of the 90s that also drew huge audiences, selling an estimated 74 million tickets in India.   
Important Considerations:

Data Accuracy: Historical box office data in India wasn't always systematically recorded and verified, making precise comparisons difficult.
Ticket Prices: Ticket prices have changed drastically over the decades. A film selling a large number of tickets in the past might have a lower gross revenue than a modern film with higher ticket prices.
Re-releases: Classic films like Sholay and Mughal-E-Azam have had multiple re-releases, contributing to their overall ticket sales.   
In conclusion, while definitive data is elusive, Sholay is overwhelmingly considered the Indian film with the highest number of tickets sold to date due to its unprecedented theatrical run and enduring popularity.
