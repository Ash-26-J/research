Based on available information up to April 4, 2025, it appears that Season 1 of Bridgerton initially garnered the highest viewership numbers.

However, Season 3 has also performed exceptionally well and even broke some records upon its release in 2024.

Here's a breakdown of what makes determining the "most popular" complex:

Initial Viewing: Season 1 had a significant impact when it was released during lockdown, likely contributing to its high initial viewership.
Netflix's Metrics: Netflix's reporting metrics have evolved over time, making direct comparisons challenging.1 They look at factors like "views" (number of households watching at least 2 minutes) and "hours viewed." Â

Long-Term Popularity and Rewatchability: While initial numbers are important, a season's long-term popularity and how often people rewatch it also contribute to its overall impact. Some fans report rewatching Season 2 or Season 3 more frequently due to their favorite couples.
Critical Reception and Fan Buzz: While not directly a measure of viewership, the critical reception and online buzz surrounding a season can indicate its popularity and cultural impact. Season 3, focusing on the popular "Polin" pairing, generated significant online discussion.
According to some reports from late 2024:

Season 1 initially held the top spot in terms of overall views.
Season 3 had a very strong debut and quickly climbed the ranks, even surpassing Season 2 in viewership within its initial viewing window.
Therefore, while Season 1 had a monumental initial impact, Season 3 has also been incredibly popular and may have surpassed Season 1 in some metrics by late 2024.
