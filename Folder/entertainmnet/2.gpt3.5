Reception: The series received mixed reviews from critics. While some praised its detailed portrayal of the piracy underworld, others felt it lacked emotional depth.

On the other hand, Only Kollywood described it as "a well-detailed and watchable look into the world of piracy," acknowledging the series' comprehensive depiction of the subject matter. ​
