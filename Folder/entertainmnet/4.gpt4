Great question! If we’re talking most-watched or highest-grossing in the Harry Potter film series, then the answer is:

🏆 "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2" (2011)
💰 Worldwide Box Office: Over $1.34 billion
🎥 Most commercially successful and widely watched entry in the entire Wizarding World franchise.

Why it topped the charts:
It was the final film — the epic conclusion after a decade of buildup.

Fans were hyped to see the ultimate showdown: Harry vs. Voldemort.

Massive emotional weight — characters died, Hogwarts was destroyed, and childhoods ended 😢.

Released in 3D and IMAX, which also boosted ticket sales.
