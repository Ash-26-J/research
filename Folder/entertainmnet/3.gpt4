The most popular season of Bridgerton (so far) is widely considered to be:

ðŸŒ¸ Season 1 (Released December 2020)
Why it blew up:
It introduced the world of the Bridgerton family with flair, scandal, and steamy drama.

Focused on Daphne Bridgerton and the brooding Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings â€” their chemistry was ðŸ”¥ and became a major obsession for fans.

It dropped during peak pandemic lockdowns â€” perfect timing for binge-watching.

Huge buzz thanks to the Shondaland production, diverse casting, and the mix of Regency-era drama with modern sensibilities (hello, string quartet playing Ariana Grande).
