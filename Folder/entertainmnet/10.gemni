The concept of the "most award-winning movie" can be looked at in a few ways:

1. Most Academy Awards Won:

Three films hold the record for the most Academy Awards won with 11 Oscars each:
Ben-Hur (1959)
Titanic (1997)
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)   
  
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is unique as it won in every category it was nominated for (11 nominations, 11 wins).   
2. Most Nominations Received:

Three films have received the most Academy Award nominations with 14 each:
All About Eve (1950) - Won 6 awards
Titanic (1997) - Won 11 awards   
La La Land (2016) - Won 6 awards
3. Total Number of Awards Won Across All Ceremonies:

It becomes significantly harder to track the movie with the highest number of wins across all possible award ceremonies globally (Oscars, BAFTAs, Golden Globes, কান চলচ্চিত্র উৎসব (Cannes Film Festival), and numerous other national and international awards). There isn't one definitive, easily accessible database for this.
Key Award Ceremonies to Consider:

Academy Awards (Oscars): The most prestigious film awards in the United States.   
BAFTA Awards: The British equivalent of the Oscars.   
Golden Globe Awards: Awards given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.   
Cannes Film Festival Awards: Highly prestigious international film festival awards.
Therefore, when people talk about the "most award-winning movie," they most often refer to the films that have won the most Academy Awards. In that context, Ben-Hur, Titanic, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King are tied for the record
