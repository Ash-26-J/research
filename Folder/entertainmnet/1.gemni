Determining the most complicated case in "House M.D." is subjective, as complexity can be measured in several ways: diagnostic difficulty, ethical dilemmas, emotional impact, or the sheer number of unusual symptoms. However, some cases stand out as particularly intricate and challenging:

Cases with Extreme Diagnostic Difficulty:

Many episodes feature incredibly rare diseases or unusual presentations of common illnesses. The team often chases numerous false leads and grapples with contradictory symptoms before finally arriving at the correct diagnosis. Examples include episodes involving:
Erdheim-Chester Disease: A very rare blood disorder that can affect multiple organs.   
Chimerism: Where a person has two sets of DNA.   
Unusual infections or toxic exposures with baffling symptoms.
  
Cases where the patient is deliberately misleading or lying. This adds a layer of psychological complexity to the medical puzzle, forcing House to rely on his understanding of human behavior as much as medical knowledge.
Cases with Significant Ethical Dilemmas:

"Giving a Daughter a Future by Cutting Her Brother's Life in Half" (Season 7, "Selfish"): This case forces the team to consider a controversial lung transplant from a sick brother to his sicker sister, knowing it will shorten the brother's life.
Cases involving experimental treatments or procedures with high risks. House often pushes the boundaries of medical ethics to save a patient's life.
Situations where the patient's wishes conflict with what the doctors believe is medically necessary.
Cases with High Emotional Impact:

Cases involving children or particularly vulnerable individuals. These often raise the emotional stakes for the team and the audience.
Cases where the patient's illness has significant personal or social consequences.
The cases involving House's personal relationships, such as Amber's fatal illness, are emotionally complex for both House and the viewers.
Cases with a Large Number of Interconnected and Confusing Symptoms:

Some patients present with a constellation of seemingly unrelated symptoms that make it incredibly difficult to pinpoint the underlying cause. These cases often require House and his team to explore a wide range of possibilities and conduct numerous tests.
Ultimately, the "most complicated" case is open to interpretation. Some viewers might find the rare disease mysteries the most complex, while others might be more affected by the ethical or emotional challenges presented in different episodes.
