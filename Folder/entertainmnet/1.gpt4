Season 4, Episode 15-16: "House’s Head" and "Wilson’s Heart" (Two-part finale)
🧠 The Case:
House is in a bus crash and sustains a traumatic brain injury, leading to memory loss. He becomes obsessed with recalling a specific detail he saw just before the crash — believing that someone on the bus is dying from a rare condition, and only he can save them.

😵 Complexity Level: INSANE
He essentially becomes both the doctor and the patient.

He self-induces hallucinations and seizures to recover his memories.

The actual diagnosis ends up being amyl nitrite toxicity (a.k.a. “poppers”), causing internal bleeding — but it takes the entire episode to unravel.

The emotional blow comes when it turns out Amber (Wilson’s girlfriend) is the patient, and House couldn’t save her. It hits hard.

Honorable Mentions:
Season 6, Episode 22: "Help Me" – A crane collapse traps a woman, and House must make brutal moral and medical decisions under pressure.

Season 2, Episode 24: "No Reason" – House is shot, and much of the episode is a trippy hallucination with a patient whose illness may or may not be real.

Season 3, Episode 4: "Lines in the Sand" – A non-verbal autistic child presents with mysterious symptoms, making diagnosis incredibly difficult.

Season 5, Episode 24: "Both Sides Now" – A patient’s two brain hemispheres are acting independently, leading to some wild neurological behavior.
