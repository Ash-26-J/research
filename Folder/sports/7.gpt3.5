AI is being increasingly used in cricket for various purposes, improving player performance, umpiring decisions, fan engagement, and analytics. Here’s how AI is making an impact:

1. Umpiring & Decision Making
Hawk-Eye Technology: Used for tracking the ball’s trajectory, predicting LBW decisions, and ensuring accurate line calls (like no-balls and stumpings).

UltraEdge/Snickometer: AI helps detect faint edges off the bat using sound and video analysis, assisting in DRS (Decision Review System).

2. Player Performance & Analytics
Smart Coaching: AI analyzes player techniques (batting, bowling, and fielding) by processing match videos and providing insights for improvement.

Wearable Sensors & Biometric Data: AI-powered wearables track players’ fitness levels, workloads, and injury risks.

3. Match Predictions & Strategy
Data-Driven Team Selection: AI crunches player stats, match conditions, and opposition weaknesses to help teams pick the best XI.

Win Probability Models: AI analyzes real-time data (like required run rate, wickets in hand, and bowler form) to predict match outcomes.

Opposition Analysis: AI studies past performances of rival players and suggests strategies (e.g., bowler variations to dismiss a key batsman).

4. Fan Engagement & Broadcasting
AI Commentary & Highlights: AI-generated voiceovers and automatic highlights make the game more interactive for fans.

Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR): AI enhances live broadcasts with player heatmaps, ball-tracking animations, and virtual stadium tours.

5. Fantasy Cricket & Betting Insights
AI models predict player performance, helping fantasy league users make informed team selections.

AI-powered tools also assist in legal sports betting by analyzing trends and patterns in cricket matches.

AI is transforming cricket into a more data-driven, precise, and engaging sport, benefiting players, coaches, umpires, and fans alik
