The Olympics originated in Ancient Greece. The first recorded Olympic Games were held in 776 BCE in Olympia, a sanctuary site in southern Greece. These ancient games were dedicated to Zeus, the chief Greek god, and featured events like running, wrestling, and chariot racing.

The modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin and were held in Athens, Greece, making Greece the official birthplace of both the ancient and modern Olympics.
