The modern Olympic Games were started by France. The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, but the initiative to revive the ancient Olympic Games came from Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France. He founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, which led to the organization of the modern Olympic Games. The ancient Olympic Games, however, originated in Olympia, Greece, around 776 BC.
