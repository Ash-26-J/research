In most bicycle races, weights are typically added to meet minimum weight regulations, especially in professional road cycling events governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). The most common materials used for these weights include:

Steel – Dense and cost-effective, often used for small weight adjustments.

Lead – Very dense and compact, though less commonly used due to toxicity concerns.

Tungsten – Extremely dense and used when space is limited, but it is expensive.

Aluminum – Lightweight but sometimes used in combination with denser materials for balance.

Brass – A good middle ground between steel and lead, offering high density and corrosion resistance.
These weights are often placed inside the bike’s bottom bracket shell, seat post, or down tube to maintain optimal weight distribution and handling.
