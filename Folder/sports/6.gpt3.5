The circles in the Olympic symbol represent unity and global participation. The five interlocking rings symbolize the union of the five inhabited continents (Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) and the meeting of athletes from around the world at the Olympic Games.

The colors of the rings (blue, yellow, black, green, and red) along with the white background were chosen because at least one of these colors appears in every national flag worldwide. The symbol was designed by Baron Pierre de Coubertin in 1913 and has since become the official emblem of the Olympics.
