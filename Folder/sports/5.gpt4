​The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece, with the earliest recorded event taking place in 776 BC in Olympia, located in the Peloponnese region. These ancient Games were held every four years as part of a religious festival honoring Zeus, the chief deity of Greek mythology. The initial event was a footrace known as the stadion, approximately 192 meters in length. Over time, the Games expanded to include various athletic competitions such as wrestling, boxing, and chariot racing. They continued for nearly 12 centuries until 393 AD, when they were suppressed by Emperor Theodosius I as part of his efforts to promote Christianity and eliminate pagan practices. ​
