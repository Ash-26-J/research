The Olympic symbol, consisting of five interlocking rings, represents the union of the world's five inhabited continents—Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania—and the coming together of athletes from around the globe for the Olympic Games. Each ring is a different color—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—chosen because every nation's flag contains at least one of these colors, symbolizing universal inclusivity.
