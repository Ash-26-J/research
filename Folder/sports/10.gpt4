​The term "Sport of Kings" has been historically associated with multiple sports, primarily polo and horse racing.​

Polo

Polo is often referred to as the "Sport of Kings" due to its longstanding association with royalty and nobility. Originating over 2,000 years ago in ancient Persia, polo was initially a training game for cavalry units and became a popular pastime among Persian nobility. The sport spread globally, maintaining its elite status and attracting royal patrons throughout history. ​
