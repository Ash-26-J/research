The five interlocking rings in the Olympic symbol represent the five continents traditionally recognized: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.   

Here's a breakdown:

Continental Representation:
Each ring symbolizes one of the five continents.
The interlocking design signifies the universality and unity of the Olympic Games, bringing together athletes from all over the world.   
Unity and Universality:
The rings are intended to represent the global coming together of athletes from every country in the world, to compete.   
It is a symbol of worldwide collaboration.
It is important to note that the colors of the rings were chosen because at least one of those colors appeared in every national flag in the world, at the time the symbol was created.   
Therefore, the circles in the Olympic symbol are a visual representation of the five continents and the unifying spirit of the Olympic Games.
