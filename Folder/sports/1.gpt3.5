In most bicycle races, weights are typically made of metal, specifically steel or lead, to meet minimum bike weight regulations. The UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) has a minimum bike weight rule of 6.8 kg (15 lbs), so if a bike is too light, teams may add weights to bring it up to the limit.

These weights are usually placed inside the bottom bracket, seat tube, or other hidden areas to maintain balance and aerodynamics.
