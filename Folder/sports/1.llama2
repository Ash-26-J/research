In most bicycle races, the focus is on minimizing weight while maintaining performance and aerodynamics. To achieve this, bicycle frames have evolved over the past century, transitioning from steel to aluminum, titanium, and finally, carbon fibers ยน.

Carbon fibers, specifically Fiber-Reinforced polymer composites, are the preferred material for bicycle frames in most races. These materials are known for being lightweight and heavy-hitting, offering the perfect balance of strength, stiffness, and aerodynamics ยน. However, it's essential to note that these materials must be accurately manufactured to specifications to ensure optimal performance and safety.
