In most bicycle races, the material commonly used for weights is carbon fiber. This material is favored due to its lightweight properties, which can significantly enhance the performance of the bicycle, especially in competitive settings. Carbon fiber frames are particularly popular among professional cyclists and enthusiasts because they allow for the construction of very lightweight bikes, often weighing less than 1 kg for the frame alone. This lightness is crucial for reducing the overall weight of the bicycle, which can improve speed and efficiency during races
