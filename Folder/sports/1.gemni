When discussing "weights" in bicycle races, it's important to differentiate between:

The materials used to construct the bicycle itself:
Professional bicycle racing emphasizes lightweight construction to maximize efficiency.   
Therefore, materials like:
Carbon fiber: Is now the overwhelmingly dominant material for high-end racing bike frames and components due to its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio.   
Aluminum alloys: Are still used, especially in more affordable racing bikes, and for certain components.   
Historically, steel and titanium have also been used, but carbon fiber has taken over the top level of racing.
Adding actual additional weights to a bicycle:
This is far less common in standard road racing. The goal is almost always to minimize weight.
However, in some very specific circumstances, riders or teams might make very minor adjustments to weight distribution. This is much less common than focusing on the lightest possible bike.
Here's a breakdown of the primary materials used in racing bicycles:

Carbon Fiber:
Offers the best combination of lightness, stiffness, and strength.
Allows for aerodynamic shaping of frames and components.   
Aluminum Alloys:
More affordable than carbon fiber.
Still relatively lightweight and strong.
Common in entry-level and mid-range racing bikes.   
Therefore, to very clearly answer the question, the material used to make the bicycles themselves, that are used in most bicycle races, is overwhelmingly carbon fiber.
