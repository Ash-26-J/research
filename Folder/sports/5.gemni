The Olympic Games originated in Ancient Greece. Specifically, they were held in Olympia.   

Here's a breakdown:

Ancient Origins:
The ancient Olympic Games date back approximately 3,000 years.   
They were held in Olympia, in the Peloponnese region of Ancient Greece.   
These games were part of a religious festival honoring Zeus.   
Modern Revival:
While the ancient games originated in Greece, the modern Olympic Games were revived by a Frenchman, Baron Pierre de Coubertin.   
The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896.   
Therefore, while the concept and the ancient games themselves originated in ancient Greece, the modern olympic games were revived by a frenchman, and the first modern games were again held in Greece
